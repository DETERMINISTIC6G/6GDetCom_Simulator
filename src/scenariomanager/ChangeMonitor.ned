// This module is responsible of gathering all important information for the scheduler,
// such as histograms and stream requirements. It observes changes in DynamicPacketSource, TsnTranslator modules
// (and also in ObservedScenarioManager module) and forwards them to ExternalGateScheduleConfigurator module.
// In case the histogram is not provided using our Histogram module, it samples the defined delay distribution. 
// In case all TsnSwitch and TsnDevice modules in the network are configured with the same number of queues, 
// it maps the PCP value to the gateIndex globally.
